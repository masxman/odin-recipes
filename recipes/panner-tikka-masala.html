		<h2> Ingredients </h2>
		<ul>

			<li>250g cubes paneer</li>
			<li>1 onion</li>
			<li>1 capsicum</li>
			<li>200ml tomato puree</li>
			<li>1 tsp red chilli powder</li>
			<li>1 tsp turmeric powder<li>
					<li>1 tsp coriander powder</li>
					<li>1/2 tsp garam masala powder</li>
					<li>100ml thick yogurt</li>
					<li>1 tsp fenugreek powder</li>
					<li>dry fenugreek leaves</li>
					<li>cardamom</li>
					<li>cumin seeds</li>
					<li>shaved ginger</li>
					<li>20ml garlic paste</li>
    <li>1 bowl corn</li>

		</ul>
		<h2> Directions </h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Take a glass container, and mix the cubed paneers with half a tea spoon of red chilli powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder, fenugreek powder, and 50g yogurt.</li>
			<li>Let the mix marinade for at least an hour. </li>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 200°C (392°F), and place the marinated paneer cubes, with onion, capsicum, and tomato on the skewers. Let them grill in the oven using skewer support, by continuously flipping them every 5 minutes until the outer crust looks crispy enough.</li>
			<li>Start heating some oil in a pan to add some cardamom and cumin seeds. Let it heat until the flavour is transfused for about a minute or two.</li>
			<li>Now add chopped onions and tomatoes to the sautee. Add some shaved ginger and garlic paste and let it sauté until some raw flavour disappears.</li>
			<li>Add the tomato purée, dry fenugreek leaves, and let it cook for about 15 minutes.</li>
<li>As the spice and tomato purée looks cooked, add some water to the mixture and let it cook more.</li>
<li> Now add the grilled paneer, some chopped vegetables of choice, corn and stir the mixture well.</li>
<li> One the added water seems to be evaporated, and the mixture looks a little thicker, turn off the heat and garnish with lemon juice, fresh coriander. (It can be served with bread of any preference.)</li>
